      <description>LToP uses a standard set of RPG dice. There are seven dice in a complete set, ranging from four to twenty sides. They are referred to by the number of sides they possess. For example, a six-sided die is called a d6. If you need to roll three six-sided dice, this will be referred to as 3d6.
The standard set includes a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. It also includes a special die, called the d100, which looks like a d10 but is numbered from 00 to 90.</description>
