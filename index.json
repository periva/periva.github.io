	"content": " This guide assumes that you already understand the basic concepts of Role-Playing Games. This section is designed to outline the basic terms you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know to play Lost Tales of Periva.\nGame Master The Game Master (GM) is a player designated as the referee of the game, enforcing the rules and making rulings on the various situations that the PCs encounter in their adventures. The GM also decides what happens in the fictional world of the game, acting out the parts of the various NPCs, creatures, and monsters. They create the world in which the characters live, and (with the help of the rules and the dice) determine the fate of the PCs.\nNon-Player Character Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are the fictional characters that are controlled by the Game Master.\nPlayer Character Player Characters (PCs) are the fictional characters controlled by the players of the game.\nParty The Party is the group of PCs represented by the players at the table. Many groups like to come up with a unique name for their band of adventurers, though this is not entirely necessary.\nAbility The Abilities are the six core attributes which define a creature’s inherent qualities. These six abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, commonly abbreviated as Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha. Abilities are represented by numbers which generally range from 3 to 18, though they can be as low as 1 or as high as 20.\nSkill A character’s Skills are representations of their training and expertise in a variety of activities. Skills are represented by numbers ranging between 0 (untrained) to 6 (expert).\nFeat Feats represent the unique qualities of a character which grant them special bonuses or abilities in certain situations. Some Feats are given during character creation, while others are purchased with Experience Points.\nExperience Point Experience Points (XP) are a type of currency which reflect the knowledge and experience gained by the players throughout their adventures. XP can be used to purchase improvements for your character, making them stronger, more capable adventurers.\nRPG Dice RPG Dice are a special set of polyhedral dice, each with a different number of sides. There are seven dice in a complete set, ranging from four sides all the way up to twenty sides. They are referred to by the number of sides they possess. For example, a six-sided die is called a d6, and if you need to roll three six-sided dice, this will be referred to as rolling 3d6.\nAction Actions are the various things characters can do in the game. Everything from attacking a feral wolf to chatting with a barkeep is considered an action. Some actions are simple, while others are more difficult.\nChallenge Challenges are particularly risky actions which could result in failure or negative consequences. Most challenges will be resolved by rolling dice.\nScene A Scene is a series of connected events that happens in one particular location.\nEncounter An Encounter is a scene in which two or more characters, creatures, or monsters are engaged in some form of conflict. This could be anything from a verbal argument to full-scale, deadly combat.\nSession A Session is the period of gameplay starting from the point when everyone arrives and starts playing and ending when everyone decides to wrap things up. Sessions generally comprise multiple scenes and encounters. Sessions are typically short, ranging from 2 to 4 hours, though there’s nothing preventing a group from playing for a longer period of time.\nAdventure An Adventure is a single quest or mission in which the PCs face opposition in the hopes of achieving a goal. Adventures vary in length, ranging from a “one-shot,” single-session adventure all the way up to an epic, multi-session quest.\nCampaign A Campaign is a long-term series of sessions which comprises many connected adventures. Campaigns can last anywhere from months to years, depending on how long the players and GM decide to keep it running. Players will typically aim to play the same PCs throughout the entire campaign, though it is possible for characters to retire or die during the course of a campaign, requiring their player to create a new character in order to continue playing.\n"

	"content": " Lost Tales of Periva Gather your friends, and tell a tale\u0026hellip; The World of Periva is vast and ancient. Its lands are scattered with the ruins of long-forgotten civilizations, temples to nameless gods, and deep, labyrinthine dungeons where lost riches and powerful artifacts have lain undisturbed for centuries. The wilderness has reclaimed what the Ancients once conquered, and the tales of those prehistoric places and their denizens are long-since lost to the maelstrom of time.\nYet Periva still thrives, its fallen kingdoms replaced by flourishing new empires which spread across the land, conquering and colonizing the world. Villagers and townspeople work to build a life for themselves, while soldiers and guards fight to protect their citizens from the ravages of beasts and bandits alike. Farmers toil year-round to eke out a living while nomadic tribes wander the forests and deserts, bartering and hunting for survival.\nAnd all throughout, the spirits of the immortal Awakened walk among them, possessing their bodies, venturing forth into those forgotten places of mystery and magic, where terrible foes and unknown riches await. Their tales of adventure and peril span eons, and are written on the face of Periva itself. And while their bodies may die, their spirits are indomitable, blessed and cursed to inhabit the world of Periva unto its end.\nYou are one of the Awakened, destined for a life of danger and glory. What tales will be told of your deeds, adventurer? "
