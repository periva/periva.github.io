	"content": " Humans were the last species to settle in Periva. Despite their late arrival, they have quickly outpaced the population of every other species on the planet. This is largely due to Humans’ adaptability and ingenuity, which have enabled them to survive just about anywhere, in any climate.\nLanguage The Human language is based largely on the invented language Esperanto, though it has assimilated a diverse array of words and idioms from the various languages of Earth as well as various Perivan cultures.\nLife Cycle Humans in Periva can live up to 115 years, though the average age of mortality is around 79. They begin puberty by age 13, reach physical maturity by age 18, and complete their mental development by age 23.\nHuman society in Periva varies significantly by region, economic status, and birthright. As such, it is difficult to make generalizations about how they spend their youth and adulthood. Humans have been known to take on many roles, from nobles to pilgrims, merchants to beggars, artists to entertainers, and everything in between.\nTo determine the starting age for a Human character, roll 2d6+11. If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 13 and 23.\nCustomization Human characters gain +2 to one Ability and +1 to another, each of your choosing. They may start with either the Mob Mentality or Well-Traveled Feat.\nHumans are generally between 4’7” to 6’4” tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 4’4” and add 3d8 inches.\n"

If the total of the six scores is less than 62, scrap the character and start over.  If you wish to use the standard set, simply assign the following six numbers in a random order: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9.\nOnce you’ve assigned your six Ability scores, regardless of the method, you may swap any two scores with each other.\n"

	"content": "Lost Tales of Periva (LToP) is a rules-light fantasy Role-Playing Game set in the World of Periva campaign setting. LToP is designed to be simple to learn without sacrificing depth of play. It can be played without miniatures, battle-mats or other expensive accessories. All you need is this guide, a complete set of RPG dice, some pencils and paper, and some friends.\nIn LToP, you will play as one of the Awakened, an immortal spirit which inhabits the world of Periva. Each character you create and play represents a denizen of Periva which is inhabited by your Awakened spirit. When one character dies or retires, your spirit is transferred to the next character you create, bringing some of its knowledge and experience along with it. In this way, even if your first character dies, the next can continue your saga, and so on.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " The Dendrani are a species of plant-like people who spend their early lives traveling throughout the world before returning to their Ancestor Grove to take root and reproduce. Due to the dangers of Periva, only the strongest and cleverest of their species survive long enough to return to the Grove. As a result, the Dendrani are a hearty species, resistant to toxins and disease. They are, however, the least populous of the sentient species of Periva, as their rate of reproduction is significantly low.\nLanguage Dendrani communicate amongst themselves through pheromonal signals transmitted through the air. However, despite a lack of vocal chords, they have managed to imitate the Common language through the rattling, clicking, and susurrus of their branches and leaves, which generally sounds like a rasping whisper.\nLife Cycle Dendrani can live up to 205 years before returning to their Ancestor Grove to take root, though most return around age 132. After taking root and reproducing, Dendrani grow to become great trees, and can survive for many centuries before death. After taking root, any Awakened that might inhabit a Dendrani will depart from its body and be reborn.\nDendrani are spawned from seed pods that hang from their parent tree. Due to natural predation, very few of these pods survive long enough to germinate. Each pod typically takes between 6 to 10 years before sprouting. Until they reach maturity, the Dendrani spend their formative years tending to—and learning from—the other trees in their Ancestor Grove. Dendrani generally reach maturity between the ages of 19 and 41, with an average of around 30 years.\nTo determine the starting age for a Dendrani character, roll 2d12+17. If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 19 and 41.\nCustomization Dendrani characters gain +2 to their Constitution or Wisdom and +1 to another Ability of your choosing. They may start with either the Leaf-Kin or Woodland Ghost Feat.\nDendrani are generally between 5’10” and 8’7” tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 5’7” and add 3d12 inches.\n"

	"content": "There are many species which call Periva their home. This section details those which players can choose for their characters.\nAll playable species are medium-sized, between 4 and 8 feet tall. Specific height ranges vary by species. All playable species have a base movement speed of 30’.\nAll playable species speak Common as well as their own species’ language. The Common language is a simplified hybrid form of the languages of the other species, designed so that all speakers, regardless of their physiology, are capable of pronouncing the words.\nA player’s first character in LToP should always be Human. When this character dies or retires, the player is free to create any character they wish. (The reasons for this distinction are detailed in the World of Periva setting information.)\nIf you’d prefer to choose your species at random, feel free to roll 2d6 and consult the following table, which takes into account a loose probability based on the population distribution of Periva:\n   2d6 Roll Species Percentage of Population     2 or 12 Leafkin 5.56%   3 or 11 Reptibian 11.12%   4-5 or 9-10 Perivan 38.88%   6-8 Human 44.45%    Each species has unique Feats which are granted upon character creation. These Feats reflect the inherent strengths of that species, adaptations which have helped them survive natural selection.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " This guide assumes that you already understand the basic concepts of Role-Playing Games. This section is designed to outline the basic terms you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know to play Lost Tales of Periva.\nGame Master The Game Master (GM) is a player designated as the referee of the game, enforcing the rules and making rulings on the various situations that the PCs encounter in their adventures. The GM also acts out the parts of the various NPCs, creatures, and monsters. They create the world which is inhabited by the Player Characters.\nNon-Player Character Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are the fictional characters that are controlled by the Game Master.\nPlayer Character Player Characters (PCs) are the fictional characters controlled by the players of the game.\nParty The Party is the group of PCs represented by the players at the table. Many groups like to come up with a unique name for their band of adventurers, though this is not entirely necessary.\nAbility The Abilities are the six core attributes which define a creature’s inherent qualities. The six abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.\nSkill A character’s Skills are representations of their training and expertise in a variety of activities. These skills include things like Athletics, Investigation, and Performance, among others.\nFeat Feats represent the unique qualities of a character which grant them special bonuses or abilities in certain situations.\nAction Actions are the various things characters can do in the game. Some actions are simple, while others are more difficult.\nChallenge Challenges are particularly risky actions which could result in failure or negative consequences. Most challenges will be resolved by rolling dice.\nScene A Scene is a series of connected events that happens in one particular location.\nEncounter An Encounter is a scene in which two or more characters, creatures, or monsters are engaged in some form of conflict. This could be anything from a verbal argument to full-scale, deadly combat.\nSession A Session is the period of gameplay starting from the point when everyone arrives and starts playing and ending when everyone decides to wrap things up. Sessions generally comprise multiple scenes and encounters. Sessions are typically short, ranging from 2 to 4 hours, though there’s nothing preventing a group from playing for a longer period of time.\nAdventure An Adventure is a single quest or mission in which the PCs face opposition in the hopes of achieving a goal. Adventures vary in length, ranging from a “one-shot,” single-session adventure all the way up to an epic, multi-session quest.\nCampaign A Campaign is a long-term series of sessions which comprises many connected adventures. Campaigns can last anywhere from months to years, depending on how long the players and GM decide to keep it running. Players will typically aim to play the same PCs throughout the entire campaign, though it is possible for characters to retire or die during the course of a campaign, requiring their player to create a new character in order to continue playing.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " The Terapex are the dominant species of Periva, despite the Humans’ greater numbers. Their empires spread across the globe long before the Humans arrived, and none but the Humans have ever challenged their dominion. They are a proud mammalian species, somewhat resembling the Fauns, Minotaurs, and Satyrs of early Human mythology on Earth. They differ widely in height and appearance, though all possess tails, bestial faces, and horns of varying length.\nLanguage The Terapex language is made up of the grunts, growls, barks, and other sounds typical of mammalian beasts. While the various Terapex subspecies speak with different voices and sounds, all are capable of understanding each other.\nLife Cycle The Terapex subspecies have a wide variety of lifespans, some as short as 56 years, others as long as 155. On average, however, Terapex live around 105 years. Most begin puberty around age 17, reach physical maturity by age 24, and complete their mental development by age 31.\nAs a communal species, much like the Dendrani, the Terapex spend their youth living and working among their elders. While their parents play an important role in their upbringing, Terapex youth are typically raised and educated by their community. They form strong tribal allegiances during this time. By the age of 24, however, most Terapex leave their tribe in order to prove themselves in the world. They are encouraged to seek alliances in other tribes, to earn glory for their own, and to produce offspring throughout the empires in order to pass along their tribe’s bloodlines. Many Terapex never return to their native tribe, instead opting to settle in another tribe, or in some cases, start their own.\nTo determine the starting age of a Terapex character, roll 2d8+15. If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 17 and 31.\nCustomization Terapex characters gain +2 to their Strength or Charisma and +1 to another Ability of your choosing. They may start with either the Beast Whisperer or Night Sight Feat.\nTerapex are generally between 5’5” and 7’8” tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 5’2” and add 3d10 inches.\n"

	"title": "Using The Dice",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "LToP uses a standard set of RPG dice. There are seven dice in a complete set, ranging from four to twenty sides. They are referred to by the number of sides they possess. For example, a six-sided die is called a d6. If you need to roll three six-sided dice, this will be referred to as 3d6.\nThe standard set includes a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. It also includes a special die, called the d100, which looks like a d10 but is numbered from 00 to 90. When paired with a d10, the d100 allows you to make percentile rolls (d%) ranging from 1 to 100. To do this, roll both dice together and add the results. For example, if the d10 shows 7 and the d100 shows 20, the result is 27. If the d10 shows 0 and the d100 shows 00, the result is 100.\nIf the player does not have a d100, they can simply roll a d10 twice. The first roll is the tens place, and the second roll is the ones place. Therefore if they roll a 2 followed by a 7, the result is 27. If both rolls show 0, the result is 100.\nThe d20 is a special die. Nearly every challenge a character faces will be resolved with a roll of the d20, whether attacking an opponent in battle, avoiding traps in a dungeon, or even haggling with a merchant. The d20 will be used more than any other die.\n"

	"content": " The Vassali are a species most closely resembled by the lizards and geckoes of Earth. Like chameleons or octopuses, they have the ability to change their coloration, and as a result their appearance varies widely. While their lives are relatively short compared to the other species, they are a very active and energetic species, eager to make the most of their time on the planet. Culturally, they are quite playful and creative.\nLanguage The Vassali language is made up of clicks, chirps, whistles, croaks, and hisses, similar to the sounds made by the reptiles and amphibians of Earth. They can also change the coloration of their skin as a rudimentary form of communication.\nLife Cycle The Vassali live relatively short lives, compared to the other playable species of Periva. Their average lifespan is around 53 years, though some have lived as many as 75 or as few as 30 years before dying of old age. Most complete their metamorphosis from childhood to adolescence by age 9, reach full physical maturity by age 12, and complete their mental development by age 15.\nUnlike the other species of Periva, the Vassali have very little attachment to their offspring or their kin. During the mating season, which lasts for about a week each year, Vassali will often enter into a frenzy, breeding with numerous mates and laying hundreds of eggs. Most of these will become food for the many predatory species of Periva, and those that hatch rarely live more than a couple years. But those that survive do so with a cunning and creativity which has earned the Vassali quite a reputation amongst the sentient species of the world.\nTo determine the starting age of a Vassali character, roll 2d4+7. If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 9 and 15.\nCustomization Vassali characters gain +2 to their Dexterity or Intelligence and +1 to another Ability of your choosing. They may start with either the Gills or MacGyver Feat.\nVassali are generally between 4’0” and 5’3” feet tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 3’9” and add 3d6 inches.\n"

	"content": " Lost Tales of Periva Gather your friends, and tell a tale\u0026hellip; The World of Periva is vast and ancient. Its lands are scattered with the ruins of long-forgotten civilizations, temples to nameless gods, and deep, labyrinthine dungeons where lost riches and powerful artifacts have lain undisturbed for centuries. The wilderness has reclaimed what the Ancients once conquered, and the tales of those prehistoric places and their denizens are long-since lost to the maelstrom of time.\nYet Periva still thrives, its fallen kingdoms replaced by flourishing new empires which spread across the land, conquering and colonizing the world. Villagers and townspeople work to build a life for themselves, while soldiers and guards fight to protect their citizens from the ravages of beasts and bandits alike. Farmers toil year-round to eke out a living while nomadic tribes wander the forests and deserts, bartering and hunting for survival.\nAnd all throughout, the spirits of the immortal Awakened walk among them, possessing their bodies, venturing forth into those forgotten places of mystery and magic, where terrible foes and unknown riches await. Their tales of adventure and peril span eons, and are written on the face of Periva itself. And while their bodies may die, their spirits are indomitable, blessed and cursed to inhabit the world of Periva unto its end.\nYou are one of the Awakened, destined for a life of danger and glory. What tales will be told of your deeds, adventurer? "
