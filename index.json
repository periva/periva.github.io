	"content": "Lost Tales of Periva (LToP) is a rules-light fantasy Role-Playing Game set in the World of Periva campaign setting. LToP is designed to be simple to learn without sacrificing depth of play. It can be played without miniatures, battle-mats or other expensive accessories. All you need is this guide, a complete set of RPG dice, some pencils and paper, and some friends.\nIn LToP, you will play as one of the Awakened, an immortal spirit which inhabits the world of Periva. Each character you create and play represents a denizen of Periva which is inhabited by your Awakened spirit. When one character dies or retires, your spirit is transferred to the next character you create, bringing some of its knowledge and experience along with it. In this way, even if your first character dies, the next can continue your saga, and so on.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " This guide assumes that you already understand the basic concepts of Role-Playing Games. This section is designed to outline the basic terms you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know to play Lost Tales of Periva.\nGame Master The Game Master (GM) is a player designated as the referee of the game, enforcing the rules and making rulings on the various situations that the PCs encounter in their adventures. The GM also acts out the parts of the various NPCs, creatures, and monsters. They create the world which is inhabited by the Player Characters.\nNon-Player Character Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are the fictional characters that are controlled by the Game Master.\nPlayer Character Player Characters (PCs) are the fictional characters controlled by the players of the game.\nParty The Party is the group of PCs represented by the players at the table. Many groups like to come up with a unique name for their band of adventurers, though this is not entirely necessary.\nAbility The Abilities are the six core attributes which define a creature’s inherent qualities. The six abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.\nSkill A character’s Skills are representations of their training and expertise in a variety of activities. These skills include things like Athletics, Investigation, and Performance, among others.\nFeat Feats represent the unique qualities of a character which grant them special bonuses or abilities in certain situations.\nAction Actions are the various things characters can do in the game. Some actions are simple, while others are more difficult.\nChallenge Challenges are particularly risky actions which could result in failure or negative consequences. Most challenges will be resolved by rolling dice.\nScene A Scene is a series of connected events that happens in one particular location.\nEncounter An Encounter is a scene in which two or more characters, creatures, or monsters are engaged in some form of conflict. This could be anything from a verbal argument to full-scale, deadly combat.\nSession A Session is the period of gameplay starting from the point when everyone arrives and starts playing and ending when everyone decides to wrap things up. Sessions generally comprise multiple scenes and encounters. Sessions are typically short, ranging from 2 to 4 hours, though there’s nothing preventing a group from playing for a longer period of time.\nAdventure An Adventure is a single quest or mission in which the PCs face opposition in the hopes of achieving a goal. Adventures vary in length, ranging from a “one-shot,” single-session adventure all the way up to an epic, multi-session quest.\nCampaign A Campaign is a long-term series of sessions which comprises many connected adventures. Campaigns can last anywhere from months to years, depending on how long the players and GM decide to keep it running. Players will typically aim to play the same PCs throughout the entire campaign, though it is possible for characters to retire or die during the course of a campaign, requiring their player to create a new character in order to continue playing.\n"

	"title": "Using The Dice",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "LToP uses a standard set of RPG dice. There are seven dice in a complete set, ranging from four to twenty sides. They are referred to by the number of sides they possess. For example, a six-sided die is called a d6. If you need to roll three six-sided dice, this will be referred to as 3d6.\nThe standard set includes a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. It also includes a special die, called the d100, which looks like a d10 but is numbered from 00 to 90. When paired with a d10, the d100 allows you to make percentile rolls (d%) ranging from 1 to 100. To do this, roll both dice together and add the results. For example, if the d10 shows 7 and the d100 shows 20, the result is 27. If the d10 shows 0 and the d100 shows 00, the result is 100.\nIf the player does not have a d100, they can simply roll a d10 twice. The first roll is the tens place, and the second roll is the ones place. Therefore if they roll a 2 followed by a 7, the result is 27. If both rolls show 0, the result is 100.\nThe d20 is a special die. Nearly every challenge a character faces will be resolved with a roll of the d20, whether attacking an opponent in battle, avoiding traps in a dungeon, or even haggling with a merchant. The d20 will be used more than any other die.\n"

	"content": "The first step in character creation is determining Ability scores. You can either roll random scores, or you can randomly assign a standard set of scores.\nTo roll for random Ability scores, follow these two easy steps:\n Roll 3d6 six times, assigning each result to an Ability in the following order: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma. If the total of the six scores is less than 62, scrap the character and start over.  If you wish to use the standard set, simply assign the following six numbers in a random order: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9.\nOnce you’ve assigned your six Ability scores, regardless of the method, you may swap any two scores with each other.\n"

	"content": " Lost Tales of Periva Gather your friends, and tell a tale\u0026hellip; The World of Periva is vast and ancient. Its lands are scattered with the ruins of long-forgotten civilizations, temples to nameless gods, and deep, labyrinthine dungeons where lost riches and powerful artifacts have lain undisturbed for centuries. The wilderness has reclaimed what the Ancients once conquered, and the tales of those prehistoric places and their denizens are long-since lost to the maelstrom of time.\nYet Periva still thrives, its fallen kingdoms replaced by flourishing new empires which spread across the land, conquering and colonizing the world. Villagers and townspeople work to build a life for themselves, while soldiers and guards fight to protect their citizens from the ravages of beasts and bandits alike. Farmers toil year-round to eke out a living while nomadic tribes wander the forests and deserts, bartering and hunting for survival.\nAnd all throughout, the spirits of the immortal Awakened walk among them, possessing their bodies, venturing forth into those forgotten places of mystery and magic, where terrible foes and unknown riches await. Their tales of adventure and peril span eons, and are written on the face of Periva itself. And while their bodies may die, their spirits are indomitable, blessed and cursed to inhabit the world of Periva unto its end.\nYou are one of the Awakened, destined for a life of danger and glory. What tales will be told of your deeds, adventurer? "
